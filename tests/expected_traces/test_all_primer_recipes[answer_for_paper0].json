          "In this cluster-randomized trial, we assigned communities in Malawi, Niger, and Tanzania to four twice-yearly mass distributions of either oral azithromycin (approxi- mately 20 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo.",
          "Children 1 to 59 months of age were identified in twice-yearly censuses and were offered participation in the trial.",
          "Vital status was determined at subsequent censuses.",
          "The primary outcome was aggregate all-cause mortality; country-specific rates were assessed in prespecified subgroup analyses.",
          "Among postneonatal, preschool children in sub-Saharan Africa, childhood mortality was lower in communities randomly assigned to mass distribution of azithromycin than in those assigned to placebo, with the largest effect seen in Niger.",
          "Any imple- mentation of a policy of mass distribution would need to strongly consider the poten- tial effect of such a strategy on antibiotic resistance.",
