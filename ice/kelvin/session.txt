It is also an essential brain compound and some hypothesize that it aids cognition by improving energy supply and neuroprotection. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the effects of oral creatine administration on cognitive function in healthy individuals. Methods: A search of multiple electronic databases was performed for the identification of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the cognitive effects of oral creatine supplementation in healthy individuals. Results: Six studies (281 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Generally, there was evidence that short term memory and intelligence/reasoning may be improved by creatine administration. Regarding other cognitive domains, such as long‐term memory, spatial memory, memory scanning, attention, executive function, response inhibition, word fluency, reaction time and mental fatigue, the results were conflicting. Performance on cognitive tasks stayed unchanged in young individuals. Vegetarians responded better than meat‐eaters in memory tasks but for other cognitive domains no differences were observed. Conclusions: Oral creatine administration may improve short‐term memory and intelligence/reasoning of healthy individuals but its effect on other cognitive domains remains unclear. Findings suggest potential benefit for aging and stressed individuals. Since creatine is safe, future studies should include larger sample sizes.

It is also an essential brain compound and some hypothesize that it aids cognition by improving energy supply and neuroprotection. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the effects of oral creatine administration on cognitive function in healthy individuals. Methods: A search of multiple electronic databases was performed for the identification of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the cognitive effects of oral creatine supplementation in healthy individuals. Results: Six studies (281 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. Generally, there was evidence that short term memory and intelligence/reasoning may be improved by creatine administration. Regarding other cognitive domains, such as long‐term memory, spatial memory, memory scanning, attention, executive function, response inhibition, word fluency, reaction time and mental fatigue, the results were conflicting. Performance on cognitive tasks stayed unchanged in young individuals. Vegetarians responded better than meat‐eaters in memory tasks but for other cognitive domains no differences were observed. Conclusions: Oral creatine administration may improve short‐term memory and intelligence/reasoning of healthy individuals but its effect on other cognitive domains remains unclear. Findings suggest potential benefit for aging and stressed individuals. Since creatine is safe, future studies should include larger sample sizes.

Risk of bias" paper="cMNgIvxWE2LCNuhQ" is_expanded="true">In the Rae et al. study, which was independently assessed, we found the following: i) the cross-over design was suitable, ii) there was no carry-over effect of treatment but iii) it is unknown if there was randomization of given treatments (creatine/placebo) (Higgins et al., 2011).

For the rest of the studies, overall ROB was high in one case due random "sequence generation" bias (selection bias) (McMorris et al., 2007a). For four included studies, overall ROB was unclear mostly because of unclear "allocation concealment" bias (selection bias) (Valenzuela et al., 2003;Ferrier et al., 2000; Moher et al., 2009 PRISMA [Internet] , n.d.; Higgins and Green, 2011) . Risk of bias for the domains "incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)" and "selective reporting (reporting bias)" was low for five studies (Valenzuela et al., 2003;Ferrier et al., 2000;Moher et al., 2009; PRISMA [Internet] , n.d.; Higgins and Green, 2011) . For the domains "blinding of participants and personnel" and "blinding of outcome assessment", bias was of low risk for three studies and of unknown risk for two studies. For "random sequence generation", risk of bias varied among studies. Finally, for "allocation concealment", risk of bias was unclear for most studies. Details regarding ROB are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 .</row>
